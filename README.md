# Enhancement-of-Brain-Hemorrhage-Images
Enhancement of Brain MRI Images for detection of Hemorrhage and its tpyes using the RSNA Dataset Available on Kaggle.
The enhancement of images is done using Un-Sharp Masking technique to increase the contrast of images so that the brain hemorrhages could easily be visible in the images and a low power ML Algorithm could be used to Classify the types of the Hemorrhage.
